DAISY
=====

This piece uses ChucK's ability to send OSC messages at audio rate to stream a "sine wave" among different computers.

Ensembles performing this piece will have two parts:
1. A single conductor, who controls who is receiving the signal and from whom
2. Various non-conductors, who each control a BPF and gain with which to control the sine wave as it passes through their control
