Enter the stage one at a time and log in.

Once you have logged in, begin typing short (2-3 character-long) greetings.
Allow this section to be calm and sparse, tentative even.
NB: Whoever is first, should make a note of being "forever alone" before the others arrive.

When everyone has logged in and performed some greetings, begin to propose topics of conversation.

Choose one of the topics and begin conversing: slowly increase the length of your statements.

Over time, let the number of spaces in your sentences grow to be greater than the number of letters in your statements.
Continue this process so that spaces even begin to infiltrate your words.
Do this until your statements look something like this:
    h     e           l                     l                o

At this point, use only one letter per statement.
Begin with a slow rate of entry and slowly accelerate.
During this time explore repetitions of single letters and small groups of letters.

Once you reach peak text entry speed, "hum": fill lines with long streams of a single letter, for example:
    mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
    -or-
    kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

Gradually shorten the length of your humming back to a single character.

Bid each member of your group farewell 5 times.
Log out.

NB: Whoever is last to log out should make a note of being "forever alone" before leaving.

END.
